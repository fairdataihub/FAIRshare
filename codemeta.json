  "version": "1.2.0",
  "description": "Simplifying the curation and sharing of biomedical research data and software according to applicable FAIR guidelines",
  "applicationCategory": "Scientific",
  "releaseNotes": "Feature additions:\nYou will now be warned when you select a GitHub repo that doesn't have the appropriate permissions. This should prevent you from accidentally uploading to a repo that you don't have permission to.\nAdded a button to let you view the repo if you decide to not publish with FAIRshare.\nAdded support for reading pre-existing codemeta files directly from your GitHub repository.\nBug fixes:\nFixed an issue where app log files were not being created in the correct location.\nFixed an issue where incorrect file keys were being read from the codemeta.json file.\nFixed some issues where certain GitHub repositories were not returning a license correctly. This was causing FAIRshare to assume an invalid license existed on the repository.\nFixed an issue where an publishing a new version of a Zenodo deposition where no orcids for authors were provided could cause the app to freeze.",
